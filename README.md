# Name Gen
Generates names using a markov chain calibrated to names stored in a .txt file (using only ascii letters) separated by newline.

Example:
```
jon
smith
geoff
```
Works better the more names you give it.

If there's a name you want more names similar to you can always add it to your .txt file.
